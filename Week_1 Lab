GCP Cloud Networking Lab Documentation
Objective
This lab provides hands-on experience with essential GCP Cloud Networking concepts. By completing it, you will understand how to set up a robust cloud network architecture covering VPCs, subnets, firewall rules, Cloud NAT, VPC peering, VPNs, and load balancers.

Prerequisites
A GCP account with billing enabled.
A new GCP project for the lab.
Lab Steps Overview
Step 1: Create a Custom VPC Network
Purpose: Establish the foundational network.
Tasks:
Create a custom VPC named main-vpc with the IP range 10.0.0.0/16.
Add two subnets:
subnet-a: 10.0.1.0/24 in us-central1.
subnet-b: 10.0.2.0/24 in us-east1.
Step 2: Configure Firewall Rules
Purpose: Manage network access securely.
Tasks:
Allow SSH access from all IPs to VMs in main-vpc.
Restrict HTTP access to specific IPs.
Set a default egress rule to block all outgoing traffic except for necessary services.
Step 3: Set Up Cloud NAT
Purpose: Enable internet access for VMs without public IPs.
Tasks:
Create a Cloud NAT named main-nat for main-vpc and enable NAT for all subnets.
Step 4: Configure VPC Peering
Purpose: Enable communication between two VPCs.
Tasks:
Create peer-vpc with a unique IP range (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16).
Set up VPC Peering between main-vpc and peer-vpc.
Verify connectivity between VMs in main-vpc and peer-vpc.
Step 5: Create a Cloud VPN for Hybrid Connectivity
Purpose: Establish a VPN connection to simulate on-premises connectivity.
Tasks:
Create a VPN named main-vpn in main-vpc.
Configure routes to direct traffic between main-vpc and an on-premises IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
Step 6: Configure Load Balancers
Purpose: Manage internal and external traffic distribution.
Tasks:
External Load Balancer:
Set up an HTTP(S) load balancer with a public IP to direct traffic to a backend service.
Internal Load Balancer:
Set up an internal TCP load balancer for private service access within main-vpc.
Step 7: Testing and Verification
Purpose: Ensure all configurations function as expected.
Tasks:
Test SSH and HTTP access based on firewall rules.
Check Cloud NATâ€™s internet access from a VM without an external IP.
Verify connectivity over VPC Peering.
Confirm VPN functionality with simulated on-prem network access.
Test internal and external load balancer routing.
Summary of Key Concepts and Skills
VPCs and Subnets: Created VPCs and regional subnets for structured network segmentation.
Firewall Rules: Configured ingress and egress controls.
Cloud NAT: Enabled internet access for VMs without public IPs.
VPC Peering: Set up connectivity between two VPCs.
VPN: Established secure network connectivity with simulated on-premises resources.
Load Balancing: Managed traffic distribution for public and internal services.
This lab consolidates foundational GCP networking skills into one comprehensive project. It serves as a practical reference for configuring and managing cloud networks in GCP, reinforcing both theoretical and practical understanding.
